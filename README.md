# Kotlion Exercise: Recycler View Basics
Exercise project to understand the concepts of using `Recycler View` to show different types of lists. It shows a list of simple words, a list of sentenes taken from the sting resource, and a list of sentences with images taken from the string and image resource. This is my takeway and implimentation of the codelab [Display a scrollable list](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-basics-kotlin-unit-2-pathway-3), for more understanding of the concept.

Three fragments containing three types of lists are displayed in the app on clicking their corresponding buttons and using `Jetpack Navigation`.
