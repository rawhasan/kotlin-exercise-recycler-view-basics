# Kotlion Exercise: Recycler View Basics
Exercise project to understand the concepts of using `Recycler View` to show different types of lists. It shows a list of simple words, a list of sentenes taken from the sting resource, and a list of sentences with images taken from the string and image resource. This is my version of a codelab from Goodle, to understand the concept properly.

Three fragments containing three types of lists are displayed in the app on clicking their corresponding buttons and using `Jetpack Navigation`.
